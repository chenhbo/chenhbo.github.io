I am Hongbo Chen (陈宏博), a joint Ph.D. student in 
<a href="https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/" class="purple-link">ShanghaiTech University</a> and <a href="https://english.ucas.ac.cn/" class="purple-link"> University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. I am affiliated to <a href="https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/" class="purple-link"> School of Information Science and Technology (SIST)</a>. My supervisor is <a href="https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/zhengrui_en/main.htm" class="purple-link"> Dr. Rui Zheng</a>. 
I visited Department of Radiology & Diagnostic Imaging in 
<a href="hhttps://www.ualberta.ca/index.html" class="purple-link"> University of Alberta</a> from July 2022 to Octorber 2023, 
supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/lel/home" class="purple-link"> Dr. Lawrence H Le</a> , 
<a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/elou" class="purple-link"> Dr. Edmond Lou</a> and
<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=NDvHoksAAAAJ&hl=en" class="purple-link"> Dr. Kumaradevan Punithakumar</a>. Before joining ShanghaiTech, 
I received a B.S. in <a href="https://sie.cust.edu.cn/" class="purple-link"> Changchun University of Science and Technology</a>, 
where I affiliated to School of Electronic Information Engineering and worked in National Experimental Teaching Demonstration Center for Electrical and Electronics. 




I am investigating the development of freehand 3D ultrasound imaging and intelligent diagnostic systems
for clinical use, including 3D reconstruction and visualization, medical object detection and surgical navigation. My research interests involve ultrasound imaging, medical image analysis, medical robotics, 
motion correction, computer vision and computer graphics.
