  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) freehand ultrasound (US) is a widely used imaging modality that allows non-invasive imaging of medical anatomy without radiation exposure. Surface reconstruction of US volume is vital to acquire the accurate anatomical structures needed for modeling, registration, and visualization. However, traditional methods cannot produce a high-quality surface due to image noise. Despite improvements in smoothness, continuity, and resolution from deep learning approaches, research on surface reconstruction in freehand 3D US is still limited. This study introduces FUNSR, a self-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction method to learn signed distance functions (SDFs) from US volumes. In particular, FUNSR iteratively learns the SDFs by moving the 3D queries sampled around volumetric point clouds to approximate the surface, guided by two novel geometric constraints: sign consistency constraint and on-surface constraint with adversarial learning. Our approach has been thoroughly evaluated across four datasets to demonstrate its adaptability to various anatomical structures, including a hip phantom dataset, two vascular datasets and one publicly available prostate dataset. We also show that smooth and continuous representations greatly enhance the visual appearance of US data. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of our method to improve segmentation performance, and its robustness to noise distribution and motion perturbation.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) freehand ultrasound (US) imaging has been applied to the investigation of spine deformity. However, it is a challenge for the current 3-D imaging reconstruction algorithms to achieve a balance between image quality and computation time. The objectives of this article are to implement a new fast reconstruction algorithm that can fulfill the request of immediate demonstration and processing for high-quality 3-D spine imaging, and to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of scoliotic curvature measurement when using the algorithm. The fast dot-projection (FDP) algorithm was applied for voxel-based nearest neighbor (VNN), multiple plane interpolation (MPI), and pixel nearest neighbor (PNN) protocols to reduce the reconstruction time. The 3-D image volume was reconstructed from the datasets acquired from scoliotic subjects. The computational cost, image characteristics, and statistical analyses of curve measurements were compared and evaluated among different reconstruction protocols. The results illustrated that the 3-D spine images using the FDP-MPI4 algorithm showed higher brightness (20\%), contrast (14\%), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (26\%) than FDP-VNN. The measurement performed by trainee rater exhibited significant improvement in measurement reliability and accuracy using FDP-MPI4 in comparison with FDP-VNN ( \$p {$<$} 0.01\$ ), and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of interrater measurement increased from 0.88 to 0.96. The FDP-PNN method could acquire and reconstruct spine images simultaneously and present the results in 1\textendash 2 min, which showed the potential to provide the approximate real-time visualization for fast screening.},

  abstract = {As an emerging medical diagnostic technology, photoacoustic imaging has been implemented for both preclinical and clinical applications. For clinical convenience, a handheld free-scan photoacoustic tomography (PAT) system providing 3D imaging capability is essentially needed, which has potential for surgical navigation and disease diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed a free-scan 3D PAT (fsPAT) system based on a handheld linear-array ultrasound probe. A global positioning system (GPS) is applied for ultrasound probe's coordinate acquisition. The proposed fsPAT can simultaneously realize real-time 2D imaging and large field-of-view 3D volumetric imaging, which is reconstructed from the multiple 2D images with coordinate information acquired by the GPS. To form a high-quality 3D image, a dedicated space transformation method and a reconstruction algorithm are used and validated by the proposed system. Both simulation and experimental studies have been performed to prove the feasibility of the proposed fsPAT. To explore its clinical potential, in vivo 3D imaging of human wrist vessels is also conducted, showing a clear subcutaneous vessel network with high image contrast.},

  abstract = {Osteopenia is considered a common phenomenon in patients who have scoliosis. Quantitative ultrasound has been used to assess skeletal status for decades, and recently ultrasound imaging using reflection signals from vertebrae were as well applied to measure spinal curvatures in children with scoliosis. The objectives of this study were to develop a new method that can robustly extract a parameter from ultrasound spinal data for estimating bone quality of scoliotic patients and to investigate the potential of the parameter in predicting curve progression. The frequency amplitude index (FAI) was calculated based on the spectrum of the original radiofrequency signals reflected from the tissue-vertebra interface. The correlation between FAI and reflection coefficient was validated using decalcified bovine bone samples in vitro, and the FAIs of scoliotic subjects were investigated in vivo with reference to body mass index, Cobb angles and curve progression status. The results revealed that the intra-rater measures were highly reliable between different trials (intra-class correlation coefficient~=~0.997). The FAI value was strongly correlated with the reflection coefficient of bone tissue (R2~=~0.824), and the lower FAI indicated the higher risk of curve progression for the non-mild scoliosis cases. This preliminary study found that the FAI method can provide a feasible and robust approach to assessment of the bone quality of spine and may be a promising factor in monitoring curve progression of patients who have adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.},

  abstract = {A 3-D ultrasound (US) imaging technique has been studied to facilitate the diagnosis of spinal deformity without radiation. The objective of this article is to propose an assessment framework to automatically estimate spinal deformity in US spine images. The proposed framework comprises four major components, a US spine image generator, a novel transformer-based lightweight spine detector network, an angle evaluator, and a 3-D modeler. The principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminative scale space tracking (DSST) method are first adopted to generate the US spine images. The proposed detector is equipped with a redundancy queries removal (RQR) module and a regularization item to realize accurate and unique detection of spine images. Two clinical datasets, a total of 273 images from adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis, are used for the investigation of the proposed framework. The curvature is estimated by the angle evaluator, and the 3-D mesh model is established by the parametric modeling technique. The accuracy rate (AR) of the proposed detector can be achieved at 99.5\%, with a minimal redundancy rate (RR) of 1.5\%. The correlations between automatic curve measurements on US spine images from two datasets and manual measurements on radiographs are 0.91 and 0.88, respectively. The mean absolute difference (MAD) and standard deviation (SD) are 2.72\^{}{\textbackslash}circ {\textbackslash}pm 2.14\^{}{\textbackslash}circ and 2.91\^{}{\textbackslash}circ {\textbackslash}pm 2.36\^{}{\textbackslash}circ , respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework to advance the application of the 3-D US imaging technique in clinical practice for scoliosis mass screening and monitoring.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a deep-learning-based detection and diagnosis technique for carotid atherosclerosis (CA) using a portable freehand 3-D ultrasound (US) imaging system. A total of 127 3-D carotid artery scans were acquired using a portable 3-D US system, which consisted of a handheld US scanner and an electromagnetic (EM) tracking system. A U-Net segmentation network was first applied to extract the carotid artery on 2-D transverse frame, and then, a novel 3-D reconstruction algorithm using fast dot projection (FDP) method with position regularization was proposed to reconstruct the carotid artery volume. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to classify healthy and diseased cases qualitatively. Three-dimensional volume analysis methods, including longitudinal image acquisition and stenosis grade measurement, were developed to obtain the clinical metrics quantitatively. The proposed system achieved a sensitivity of 0.71, a specificity of 0.85, and an accuracy of 0.80 for diagnosis of CA. The automatically measured stenosis grade illustrated a good correlation ( r = 0.76) with the experienced expert measurement. The developed technique based on 3-D US imaging can be applied to the automatic diagnosis of CA. The proposed deep-learning-based technique was specially designed for a portable 3-D freehand US system, which can provide a more convenient CA examination and decrease the dependence on the clinician's experience.},
