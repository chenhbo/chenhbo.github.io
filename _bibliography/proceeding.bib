  abstract = {The reconstruction of high-quality shape geometry is crucial for developing freehand 3D ultrasound imaging. However, the shape reconstruction of multi-view ultrasound data remains challenging due to the elevation distortion caused by thick transducer probes. In this paper, we present a novel learning-based framework RoCoSDF, which can effectively generate an implicit surface through continuous shape representations derived from row-column scanned datasets. In RoCoSDF, we encode the datasets from different views into the corresponding neural signed distance function (SDF) and then operate all SDFs in a normalized 3D space to restore the actual surface contour. Without requiring pre-training on large-scale ground truth shapes, our approach can synthesize a smooth and continuous signed distance field from multi-view SDFs to implicitly represent the actual geometry. Furthermore, two regularizers are introduced to facilitate shape refinement by constraining the SDF near the surface. The experiments on twelve shapes data acquired by two ultrasound transducer probes validate that RoCoSDF can effectively reconstruct accurate geometric shapes from multi-view ultrasound data, which outperforms current reconstruction methods.

However, the current imaging apparatus is bulky and not portable. The objective of this study is to develop a new compact and wireless system to offer the real-time visualized spine images during data acquisition. A portable and WI-FI based ultrasound scanner and a compact EM tracking system were assembled to acquire ultrasound transverse frames with location information which could be reconstructed into 3D spine image volume in real-time. The validation was implemented on the 2D coronal images of vertebra phantoms, and the in vivo data acquisition and reconstruction were demonstrated on volunteers. The result showed that the new system could provide reconstructed spine images in real time and the average errors of the reconstructed images were about 1mm (approximate to image pixel size).},

  abstract = {The Voxel-Based Nearest Neighbor method (VNN) is the most commonly used three-dimensional ultrasound (US) image reconstruction algorithm for spine imaging on scoliotic patients. The neural radiance field (NeRF) method is a newly developed reconstruction algorithm in computer vision area, which utilizes a weighted multilayer perceptron to rebuild the volumetric density and color of a 3D scene. The objectives of this study are to apply the NeRF algorithm for the reconstruction of 3D US spine data and to evaluate the spinal curvature measurement from the reconstructed results. The conventional VNN and NeRF method were used to reconstruct 3D ultrasound volume data for 25 scoliotic subjects. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between different reconstruction methods and the correlation between US and radiographic measurements were calculated. The result demonstrated that the new 3D reconstruction algorithm based on the NeRF algorithm could provide higher-quality 3D US spine images with highlighted bone structures and lower noise, moreover lead to better estimation of spine curves with smaller errors comparing to the VNN method.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method has been shown as a promising tool for automatic curve assessment of scoliosis without time-consuming manual measurement. However, CNN-based method was not reliable to accurately identify vertebral levels. The objective of this study is to investigate the performance of DEtection with TRansformer (DETR) for lamina detection, spine curve measurement and vertebral level identification. The implementation process included the following three steps: 1) automatic detection of lamina pairs based on deep learning methods; 2) assessment of the spinal curvature; 3) identifying the vertebral levels. Total 254 ultrasound images obtained from scoliotic patients were used for the training and evaluation of the proposed method. The average precision (AP) of lamina pairs detection using DETR and Faster R-CNN were 86.12 and 82.03, respectively. Compared to Faster R-CNN, DETR showed smaller MAD (4.47\textdegree{$\pm$}3.71\textdegree{} vs 5.3\textdegree{$\pm$}4.77\textdegree ) and higher correlation (0.90 vs 0.85), especially the MAD of DETR was less than the clinical acceptable error (5\textdegree ). For vertebral level identification, the mean accuracy rate using DETR was increased by 2.8\% than Faster R-CNN, while the mean error rate and redundancy rate was reduced by 62\% and 71\%. The results demonstrated that the transformer-based detection network could achieve more reliable performance on scoliotic curve assessment and vertebral level identification.},

To promote the clinical application of this technology, a 3D photoacoustic tomography (PAT) system that can realize flexible scanning and 3D large FOV imaging is essentially need. In this paper, we developed a 3D PAT system using a hand-held linear ultrasound transducer array combined with a positioning system. The acquired 2D images and location information can be acquired in the real-time and then processed to realize the online 3D imaging using a dedicated 3D reconstruction algorithm. Both the simulation and in-vivo study have been conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed system. The result of 3D PAT imaging on human wrist shows clear outline of the blood vessel with complete structure in 45 mmx38 mmx20 mm volume size, which well proved its feasibility for clinical applications in the future.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) intraoral ultrasonography has shown promising potential to image the periodontal structures without the ionizing radiation. To advance the clinical application of intraoral ultrasonography, a novel ultrasound imaging system is necessary to image the structure of periodontal anatomy in 3D space. In this study, we developed a portable 3D intraoral imaging system by consisting of a handheld high-frequency linear intraoral ultrasound transducer (up to 23 MHz) and an optical tracking system. The proposed system can consistently provide the 2D images with 3D poses information for the real-time online reconstruction. After the online reconstruction, a total variation regularization (TVR) technique was adopted to filter the noise in raw tracking poses during the freehand scanning. The validation was performed on two incisors of a mandibular phantom, and the reconstructed volume from the proposed system was compared with the volume from Micro Computed Tomography ({\textmu}CT). The global average absolute and relative errors measured on the width and height of the two incisors were 0.16{\textpm}0.06 mm and 2.63{\textpm}1.50\%, respectively. The TVR-corrected reconstructed volumes revealed a smoother reconstructed surface. This in-vitro study demonstrated a comparable result of the proposed system with {\textmu}CT to image the dental phantom.},

  abstract = {Accurate 3D geometric shapes of carotid arteries are imperative for the three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) imaging to clinically assess the carotid atherosclerosis (CA). However, the traditional surface reconstruction method, such as iso-surface (ISO-SURF), suffers from the image noise, voxel resolution and additional processing. In this paper, we introduce the neural implicit representation based on the deep learning network for the 3D surface reconstruction of media-adventitia boundary (MAB), plaque, and lumen-intima boundary (LIB) together. The unsigned distance functions are learned by the network to generate the mesh. For the validation, six volumes were simulated in carotid shape with MAB and LIB, and random noise was added around the boundaries. The results showed that experiments on six simulated volumes illustrated better performance than ISO-SURF, with 47\%, 36\%, and 55\% decrease in Chamfer distance, average absolute distance, and Hausdorff distance, respectively. The visualization results from the CA clinical data revealed a smoother and more continuous geometric surface than ISO-SURF. The comparison result has shown the potential of the proposed method to examine vascular pathologies in the future.},
